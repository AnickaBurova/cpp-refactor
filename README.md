# cpp-refactor package

At current time, this package is a quick hack of some useful features, while I develop. If it is working for me, then it is fine.

Eventually this should provide some C++ refactoring.

For now only useful feature is find-class. It will search header files and open the first match. Might not work for some edge cases. Not fully tested. (alt-cmd-r f)
