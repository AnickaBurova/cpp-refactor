# cpp-refactor package

Features:
* Find class declaration. This is very simple bruteforce to find where the class is declared. If the declaration is found, the file is opened at that positition.

By mistake I have published major version 2, and it didn't work to unpublished. So we have version 2:)

I have moved non refactoring features in to package anca-misc.
