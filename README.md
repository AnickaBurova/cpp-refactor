# cpp-refactor package

Features:
* Find class declaration. This is very simple bruteforce to find where the class is declared. If the declaration is found, the file is opened at that positition.

By mistake I have published major version 2, and it didn't work to unpublished. So we have version 2:)

I have moved non refactoring features in to package anca-misc.

There are two keymaps to run find-class. One with cmd and one with ctrl. I tried to use platform specific, it did even create these keymaps, but they didn't work. I don't know how to use this feature properly, and couldn't find any good documentation.
