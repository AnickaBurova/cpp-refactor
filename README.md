# cpp-refactor package

Features:
* Find class declaration. This is very simple bruteforce to find where the class is declared. If the declaration is found, the file is opened at that positition.

These are mostly irrelevant to cpp refactoring but I find them useful to have:
* Copy filepath or filename to clipboard. (to be able to copy the text to clipboard, I am insterting the text in to the current editor and cutting it into clipboard; couldn't find other way)

By mistake I have published major version 2, and it didn't work to unpublished. So we have version 2:)
